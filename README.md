Pin My Map offers users the ability to record places they have visited using the Mapbox APIs. Users can register an account and simply pin locations on the world map, add details and photos, as well as share their personalised map page on social networks. It is built using React with Material UI and Styled Components, and powered by a Strapi back-end.
